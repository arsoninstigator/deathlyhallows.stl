# deathly hallows pendant
i wanted to make something harry potter or percy jackson themed that wasn't all that complex or even time consuming so i picked this because i can just carve it easily (gotta buy some wax tho i keep forgetting). ps. "harry potter and the goblet of fire" and "harry potter and the deathly hallows #1 and #2" are truly top #5 movies ever made ,,, and i watch a lot of movies. cinematic masterpieces.
